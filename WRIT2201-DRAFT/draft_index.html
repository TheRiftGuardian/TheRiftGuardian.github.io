											<h3>The Issue</h3>
											<p>University websites are the bane of many new and current students whose frustration stems from poorly designed layouts, outdated information, and a plethora of other flaws. These flaws, often accentuated during enrollment times, flood the registration office with questions unknowingly provided by the university’s website. This buried information caused by poorly designed websites creates unnecessary discomfort for both students and staff. As time continues to go on, education becomes more prominent and sought-out for; Surely, websites are updated to keep up with society’s demand</p>

											<p>However, that is not the case. The article “University websites: The so-so, the bad, and the egregious” written by Melonie Fullick goes over issues university websites currently have. Fullick mentions how these flaws are an “ongoing [problem], and one that generates much wailing and gnashing of teeth among regular users of the sites, including current students and faculty (Fullick, 2016)”. She brings up issues such as “design, navigation and site search (Fullick, 2016)”, “infuriating ‘link loops (Fullick, 2016)’, and “buried information (Fullick, 2016)”. All issues disrupt the procedure of enrollment and swarm universities’ registration offices with questions. The faculty is outnumbered and unable to keep up with the constant flux of questions overwhelmed and unable to answer timely. This back-and-forth between students and staff, often slowed by response time, creates unnecessary frustration which could easily be resolved by improvements to university websites. So why do universities not improve their websites? That is the issue; Although Fullick’s issues are relevant to current flaws in university websites, it was written almost 7 years ago.
											</p>

											<p>
												York University’s website also shares these flaws. Users of social media platforms like Reddit and Twitter share their frustration often with rants targeted towards York’s enrollment system. KyubiMo, a user of Reddit posted their complaint; Issues like being blocked access to enrollment in core classes and being unable to obtain their preferred schedule were mentioned. KyubiMo had “a schedule planned weeks before (KyubiMo, 2020)” and was not able to enroll. This had the user often “anxiously checking (KyubiMo, 2020)” and frustrated. More users voicing their experiences follow the same pattern. It is clear York has issues with enrollment.

											</p>

											<p>We will primarily focus on a solution to the functionality and overall user experience of York’s enrollment process. Currently, York’s website is filled with buried information and broken links that make the enrollment process a maze to navigate through. We look towards Manzoor’s investigation in “Methodological investigation for enhancing the usability of university websites”'. Manzoor provides a usability metric that compares 86 university websites, including York University. His findings mention ‘all students were in favor of the absence of broken links ( Manzoor et al. 539)’. This highlights an absolute rejection from students of broken links that appear on universities’ websites. York’s enrollment process is no stranger to broken links and as a result of outdated pages, which obstruct York’s enrollment process creating frustration among students. Another framework we can look towards for improved user experience is a guideline for sustainable web design. Mihai Teichindelean in “A comparative Eye Tracking Study of Usability-Towards Sustainable Web Design '' provides us with three similar categories to Manzoor’s metrics:
											<ul>
											<li>Increased finability, content and search engine optimization (SEO) - reducing meaningless content, easy-to-find information, data with clear purpose and utility, the inclusion of tools such as search buttons;
</li>
											<li>Web performance optimization – fast loading websites consume less energy while keeping users happy;
</li
											><li>Design and user experience (UX) - creating enjoyable online experiences, removing information overload, keeping things simple, easily apprehensible, ensuring valuable information, generating high conversion rates and positive brand perception.</li>
											<p>(Tichindelean et al.  3)</p>
										</ul>

Both frameworks share the need to create websites catering to user experience. Although Teichindelean’s framework was created with environmental sustainability in mind, we can use it as a reference. Teichindelean concludes “A qualitative UX will positively impact memory and website familiarity; these aspects have been shown to be in close relation with consumer satisfaction and loyalty(Tichindelean et al.  4)”. By including tools such as buttons and easy-to-find information in York’s enrollment process we can provide students an enjoyable experience. An improvement to UX will allow students to navigate through York’s website, obtain easy-to-find information, and further attract new potential students to York University. These frameworks provide a solution to the buried information issue mentioned by Fullick.

											<h3>Why is a solution important?</h3>
											<p>Improvements to York’s website are necessary to accommodate the growing number of students enrolling in university. Up-to-date information and positive user experience allow York to compete with other universities. By creating a positive, more memorable experience when enrolling into York potential students are more attracted to attend. Ridding the issues of buried information and broken links allows students to obtain the information they need; Which allows the administration office to focus on more specific issues. As students are contacted promptly, user experience and satisfaction continue to increase.</p>
											<p>We look towards a case study regarding Smartphone Applications as a reference to our solution. Although the case study is in a different format, the guidelines and principles mentioned will help provide an easy-to-implement solution. In “Handbook of Usability and User-Experience: Research and Case Studies”, Soares examines the five attributes of usability. We mention three out of five relating to our proposed solution:
 “Efficiency: the quality of resources appropriated in a product in terms of the relation to the accuracy and completeness by which users achieve goals”,
“Satisfaction: the quality of positive attitudes towards the comfortable use of the product”, and “Errors: the quality of having a low error rate, so that users can easily recover from them and that gross errors must not occur.
” (Soares et al. 242-243).
Soares also mentions heuristics from Nielsen rule, Google, and Apple that serve as guidelines
for usability. These heuristics share rules for “user control (Soares et al. 243)”, and “consistency (Soares et al. 243)” each providing their own definition.
</p>

											<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
											<p>Our proposed solution is easy to implement and a step towards improving York’s enrollment process. Currently, York University shares two different timetable applications. One is VSB capable of modifying course schedules (visual schedule builder) and another is a plain text application used for visualization. We refer to the usability heuristics on consistency. Google’s usability guidelines describe consistency as “Looks alike; performs alike”. Since the latter timetable application essentially strips users of functionality we should work towards streamlining VSB as the only timetable application. This would provide students with the same capabilities they previously had for future modifications that potentially occur as the drop course deadline approaches. Our solution looks towards an “Import to VSB” button that appears on York’s registration and enrollment module. This would remove potential errors that currently occur during enrollment when students input CAT #s; Which are unique identifiers for courses. This accomplishes all three mentioned attributes of usability. Efficiency and Satisfaction are obtained through one click as students can modify their schedule immediately. Removing the tedious task of strictly checking between timetables to make modifications makes York’s enrollment process more satisfying. The Error attribute is accomplished since we reduce human errors by allowing the backend of York’s website to input the Cat #s instead of students. Essentially, it removes typos, unintended modifications, and planning. Streamlining VSB as the only timetable application allows students to have more freedom and user control. Google’s definition of user control says it best “Decide for me, but leave the final decision to me (Soares et al. 243)”. With the help of a button, students will have more confidence in deciding their schedule.</p>

											<p>This solution can easily be implemented because York’s VSB and REM already utilize Cat #s. Since both of them share the same unique identifier for courses the process of importing them to VSB and vice versa is simple. We use both Teichindelean and Manzoor frameworks as references to what students want. By solving this issue with a student’s viewpoint in mind, this solution utilizes VSB through the use of a button. We potentially create an enjoyable online experience that keeps things simple and provides students with the information they need.
